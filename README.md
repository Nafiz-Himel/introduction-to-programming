# Introduction to Programming

This project and the “Introduction to Programming” folder belong to my learning path as part of the first semester of the “CSE Fundamentals with Phitron” course, where I learn programming in C and problem‑solving basics.

## 📚 Topics Covered

Currently included:

- Week 1 – Orientation  
- Week 2 – Recap and Array  
- Week 3 – Array and String Operations  
- Week 4 – Nested Loop Recap, Function & Pointer  
- Week 5 – 2D Array and Recursion  

## 🧠 What You’ll Learn

This repo helps you (and me) understand basic programming building blocks such as:

- Data types and variables  
- Loops and nested loops  
- Arrays and 2D arrays  
- Strings and string operations  
- Functions  
- Pointers and memory concepts  
- Recursion  

These topics form the foundation for writing programs, solving problems, and understanding more advanced CS concepts.
